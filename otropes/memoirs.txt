  

  



 

                   

A story like mine should never be told.



 

                   

For my world is as

forbidden as it is fragile.



 

                   

Without its mysteries it cannot survive.



 

                   

I certainly wasn't born

to the life of a Geisha.



 

                   

Like so much in my strange life



 

                   

I was carried there by the current.



 

                   

The first time I knew

my mother was sick,



 

                   

was when my father threw

the fish back into the sea.



  

                   

That night we went hungry, to

understand emptiness he told us.



  

                   

Mother always said that my

sister Satsu was like wood.



  

                   

As rooted to the earth as a Sagura

tree. But she told me I was like water.



  

                   

Water can carve its

way, even through stone.



  

                   

And when trapped,

water makes a new path.



  

                   

-These are the girls from Tanaka?

-Sisters, yes, from Yurida.



  

                   

This one maybe, the other one no.



  

                   

Show your respect for mother. You

must not speak, I will answer for you.



  

                   

Kneel, and head down,

never look her in the face.



  

                   

-How old are you?

-She’s year of the rooster.



  

                   

Only nine...



  

                   

Where is my sister?



  

                   

Let me see those eyes.



  

                   

Look at me.



  

                   

-Too much water.

- But mother, a little water is good to guard against fire.



  

                   

You wouldn't have to worry about the

okea burning, losing all your people, no....



  

                   

These country girls! Too

late to send her back now.



  

                   

Go.



  

                   

Pumpkin, keep her quiet,

mother is downstairs



  

                   

Let me go!



  

                   

Let me go! Let me go!



  

                   

-Mother will hear you! She's got a bamboo stick.

-I want my sister. Satsu!



  

                   

I cried too at first.



  

                   

You know it is easier if you just forget

everything that happened before you came to the okea.



  

                   

If you impress mother,

and do exactly as she says,



  

                   

She will send you to

school to be a Geisha.



  

                   

-A what?

-A Geisha, like Hatsumomo.



  

                   

You will get to drink

sake, and sleep until noon.



  

                   

-Where is my sister?

-Probably in another okea in Hanonoke.



  

                   

Your family sold you to this

house, you live here now.



  

                   

Outside you wear these, inside these.



  

                   

We don't display our

naked feet like monkeys.



  

                   

It's not flesh we're selling here,



  

                   

This is a Geisha house.



  

                   

Remember to always honour this okea.



  

                   

You listen, you learn, now get to work.



  

                   

Be quiet Hatsumomo is sleeping.



  

                   

-Pumpkin, when can I go outside?

-Outside the okea? You can't.



  

                   

It’s not allowed.



  

                   

How will I find Satsu?



  

                   

You can't just walk out to

every house in Hanamachi.



  

                   

Do you know how many there are?



  

                   

Look.



  

                   

Tighter!



  

                   

Chiyo, Chiyo-chan



  

                   

Come.



  

                   

Two nights ago, Hatsumomo had to

stay at the Tea-house until dawn,



  

                   

thats what she told mother.



  

                   

But she was really here

with a man, the whole...



  

                   

Why can't you be quiet?!



  

                   

So, this is the new arrival.



  

                   

A pity she still stinks of fish.



  

                   

Stay out of my room.



  

                   

Your fingers smell .I can't

have you touching my things!



  

                   

Only reason mother tolerates Hatsumomo

is because she brings in good money.



  

                   

Never forget it is Hatsumomo

who pays for your supper,



  

                   

the clothes on your back.



  

                   

By the time she was twenty, she had

already earned back her purchase price.



  

                   

She has been the talk of

the Hanamachi ever since.



  

                   

-These are all hers?

-Certainly not, they belong to the okea.



  

                   

A Geisha needs an elegant wardrobe,

just like an artist needs ink.



  

                   

If she's not properly dressed

then she is not a true Geisha.



  

                   

-Nobody told me what a Geisha is.

-You will find out soon enough.



  

                   

I have news for you child, mother has determined

that it is off to school with you.



  

                   

You are to become Geisha!



  

                   

Chiyo, Pumpkin!



  

                   

Quick quick, don't be

late, and you will be late.



  

                   

Go,go.



  

                   

This way.



  

                   

Pumpkin, Pumpkin…



  

                   

I'm going to run, I'm

going to find Satsu.



  

                   

Not yet you don't.



  

                   

You will ruin your own

chances, and mine too.



  

                   

Please,stay with me.



  

                   

Squid!



  

                   

Look for your sister's name later!



  

                   

You are late!



  

                   

Chiyo, where is granny's food?



  

                   

Where have you

been? It’s freezing cold!.



  

                   

Close the window. Hai! (yes).



  

                   

Chiyo, Chiyo, come quickly.



  

                   

Hatsumomo is at the bath-house



  

                   

-Here tidy up.

-But she told me to stay ... !



  

                   

Hatsumomo does not run this okea.



  

                   

Look who's in my room...



  

                   

Did you touch this?



  

                   

I can just hear the General now why

Hatsumomo, you used to smell of jasmine,



  

                   

What’s this new perfume? Blowfish?



  

                   

I told you to never to touch my

things. Can’t you understand why?



  

                   

Because your general will

say, Hatsumomo you stink!



   

                   

At least you don't smell as bad as

your sister.You know, she was here...



   

                   

She came by looking for you.



   

                   

What?



   

                   

Was I wrong to ask her to leave?



   

                   

Please, tell me where she is.



   

                   

Only if you swear yourself

to me first.Yes? Huh?



   

                   

Now get out!



   

                   

Hatsumomo you'll wake the entire

house. Your big sister is thirsty, so am I,



   

                   

go and get us some beer.



   

                   

-I'm not in the mood for beer.

-I know what you're in the mood for.



   

                   

And his name is Koichi



   

                   

What did you say Korin?



   

                   

I'm sorry.I forgot.



   

                   

You're just jealous

someone cares for me!



   

                   

Guess who this belongs to? A Geisha as desired as

she is ought to keep a closer eye on her clothes.



   

                   

It’s Mameha's?!



   

                   

How did you get it? Bribed her maid.



   

                   

We can't, give it to her.



   

                   

Chiyo, come, come.



   

                   

Now then little Chiyo, it is

time to practice your calligraphy.



   

                   

There.



   

                   

Remember, you swore yourself to me. Yes.



   

                   

Don't let anybody see you.



   

                   

Go, go!



   

                   

This will teach the great Mameha.



   

                   

Thieving rat!.



   

                   

-That kimono was worth more than you.

-Careful, you will hurt yourself more than her.



   

                   

Let me.



   

                   

Kneel. What have you done to Hatsumomo?



   

                   

-I haven't done anything, I promise you.

-Her little trick with than kimono will cost  you.



   

                   

Whatever you have done to anger

her, you'd be wise to stop, now!



   

                   

Lie down. I will beat you hard,



   

                   

So mother does not beat you harder.



   

                   

I told you not to let anybody see you.



   

                   

I have kept my promise,

so tell me, where is she?



   

                   

She is in the next ...

in the house called Tatsuyo.



   

                   

In the pleasure district.



   

                   

Trust me little Chiyo,

you will find her.



   

                   

Tatsuyo? Satsu, Satsu, Satsu…



   

                   

Satsu, Satsu, no! Satsu! Satsu!



   

                   

Satsu, Satsu!



   

                   

Chiyo, what took you so

long? But Satsu, I tried...



   

                   

I went to your okea weeks ago,

they laughed and turned me away.



   

                   

Please, I did not know

I’ve missed you so much.



   

                   

Let’s leave, tonight.

But we need money too.



   

                   

I know I can steal some, first

thing tomorrow… No, please, tonight!



   

                   

No, tomorrow, meet me at the

Saturn-May bridge, as soon as it's dark.



   

                   

Now I have to go.Quickly

before someone catches you.



   

                   

What if I cannot get away?



   

                   

Be there Chiyo, we only have one chance.



   

                   

Once I’ve left I can't go

back.I’ve waited as long as I can.Now go.



   

                   

What is she doing here? She’s seen us!



   

                   

Stupid girl, why have you come

back? You’re probably trying to escape!



   

                   

Get in!



   

                   

- Koichi please!

-Look at this, we're sneaking around like criminals!



   

                   

-Koichi don't!

-It's degrading!



   

                   

-What's going on?

-Koichi…



   

                   

Who's there?



   

                   

Go.



   

                   

Show your face!



   

                   

Look mother, I caught her stealing.



   

                   

She was running away

with her sister,the whore!



   

                   

-You little thief!

-No, she's lying.



   

                   

After all we've done for her!



   

                   

I saw her with a man, right

there! His name is Koichi!



   

                   

Shut up! We should kick her out.



   

                   

Take her arms.



   

                   

You are never to see him again, huh?



   

                   

What do you think? A

Geisha is free to love?



   

                   

Never! Bolt the gate.No

one is leaving this okea!



   

                   

Doctor Ohura is very expensive. You

seem to be racking up quite a debt, huh?



   

                   

Kimono destroyed, Geisha school, rice and

pickles, train ticket,Mr. Bekku, ... all this...



   

                   

… on top of the money I paid Mr. Tanaka?



   

                   

And for what? And now I hear

that your sister has run away.



   

                   

She didn't wait for you and

now she can never come back.



   

                   

You must forget you

ever had a sister, huh?



   

                   

We are your only family now.



   

                   

Dear Satsu and little Chiyo, as one

who was once an orphan child myself,



   

                   

this humble person is sorry to inform you,that six

weeks after you left for your new life in Myoko…



   

                   

… the suffering of your honoured

mother came to it's end …



   

                   

And only a few weeks afterwards your

honoured father departed this world as well.



   

                   

This humble person feels confident that both your honoured

parents have found their places in paradise.



   

                   

At the temple there is a poem

called "loss",carved into the stone.



   

                   

It has three words, but the

poet has scratched them out.



   

                   

You cannot read loss, only feel it.



   

                   

My father and mother had left this

life, my sister I never heard from again.



   

                   

I had dishonoured the okea,so

mother had other plans for me.



   

                   

I would pay back my debt,

year,after year,after year.



   

                   

Not as a Geisha, as her slave.



   

                   

It is too pretty a day to be

so unhappy. Did you fall down?



   

                   

Why so shy? Nothing to be ashamed of.



   

                   

We all stumble from time to time.



   

                   

You see that enchanting lady in green?



   

                   

Once, when she was just a miko (an apprentice

Geisha), she fell clean off her wooden shoes.



   

                   

-It's true, I did.

-And now look at her, so elegant!



   

                   

Mr. Chairman, shouldn't we hurry?We

will miss the beginning.



   

                   

We see the Spring dances

every year.We can spare a moment.



   

                   

What's your name? Don't

be afraid to look at me.



   

                   

Do you like sweet plum or cherry?



   

                   

You mean to eat?



   

                   

I like sweet plum myself.



   

                   

Come.



   

                   

None of us find much kindness

in this life, as we should.



   

                   

Both kinds please.



   

                   

My children wait for these every Spring.



   

                   

-Now I am a Geisha too.

-So you are.



   

                   

How did you come by

such surprising eyes?



   

                   

-My mother gave them to me.

-Generous of her wasn't it?



   

                   

As you have been to me.



   

                   

Smile for me won't you?



   

                   

There now, that is your gift to me.



   

                   

This will buy your

supper. Now promise me one thing.



   

                   

Next time you take a tumble, no frowns.



   

                   

That's better.



   

                   

In that moment I changed from a

girl, facing nothing but emptiness



   

                   

to someone with purpose.I saw that to

be a Geisha could be a stepping stone



   

                   

to something else: a place in his world.



   

                   

The money the chairman had given me,

could have bought fish and rice for a month,



   

                   

but I gave it back in prayer,

keeping only his handkerchief.



   

                   

I asked one day to become a Geisha,

and then somehow, to meet him again.



   

                   

-Chiyo

-chan? I can't find my coat, did you found it yet?



   

                   

Pumpkin it's time to go.



   

                   

I found it.



   

                   

I couldn't sleep last night I was

so worried about my stupid hair.



   

                   

Am I lopsided? You look beautiful.



   

                   

With your hair like that you look

more like a pumpkin than ever.



   

                   

Don't fold your neck

forward like a tortoise.



   

                   

She's not ready? We will be late.



   

                   

Poor pumpkin, her debut and

everybody will be staring at you.



   

                   

Hurry up. This time, do your ... before you play, when

you make a fool of yourself your big sister gets the blame



   

                   

Stop crying, your face will run.



   

                   

Pumpkin!



   

                   

The winter I turned fifteen

I saw the chairman again,



   

                   

But that wasn't the only surprise

fate brought me that season.



   

                   

Along with the snow came

a most unexpected  visitor.



   

                   

Why is she here?



   

                   

Chiyo, Chiyo, open the gate!



   

                   

Now that your beloved granny has

gone you have no need for a maid.



   

                   

I would never question the great Mameha,

but you could choose anyone in the Hanamachi.



   

                   

You flatter me, truly.



   

                   

I would give you my pumpkin if she

weren't already tied to Hatsumomo.



   

                   

Please I would never dream of asking. Besides,

I can always sell Chiyo to Mrs. Tetsuyo.



   

                   

With your eye for beauty

and nose for talent,



   

                   

surely you can see what a

terrible waste that would be.



   

                   

If you were not the kind hearted

Geisha I know you to be,



   

                   

then I might think that you were

scheming against Hatsumomo.



   

                   

Then I'm grateful Mrs. Nita that

you don't have a suspicious mind.



   

                   

Perhaps you can

pique my interest with...



   

                   

-Your offer.



   

                   

I will cover Chiyo's schooling, all

her expenses, until after her debut.



   

                   

Now I am confident that you are teasing.



   

                   

I could not be more sincere.



   

                   

If Chiyo has not repaid her debt

within six months after her debut.



   

                   

-Impossible, too little time!

- Then I will pay you twice over.



   

                   

What... ?



   

                   

-No Geisha could ever...

- I am certain you will not object to one trivial condition.



   

                   

-Uh yes...?

-If Chiyo erases her debt in the time allowed,



   

                   

You will not have any part

in her future earnings.



   

                   

It's too good to be true,

Mameha is up to something.



   

                   

She isn't in it for the money,

that much is for certain.



   

                   

Rumour has it, ever since the Prime

Minister bought her misuage(virginity)



   

                   

-She's been rich.



   

                   

Absurd hard to think

that she noticed Chiyo.



   

                   

-It's that kimono, she remembers how you

destroyed it, now she wants to get even.



   

                   

An odd picture isn't it?



   

                   

Hatsumomo sweeping into tea-house after

tea-house with our Pumpkin, and Mameha with our maid.



   

                   

I'm so far behind, I will

never catch up to you.



   

                   

-Don’t worry, I will help you.

-Pumpkin!



   

                   

You are never to speak to her

again, now you  are rivals!



   

                   

This is how it was, this

tiny world of women,



   

                   

friend turned against friend.



   

                   

And now the two greatest

Geisha in Myoko at war over me.



   

                   

Hatsumomo at my back, Mameha calling,



   

                   

offering me the chance to become one of

those elegant women I had seen on the bridge.



   

                   

floating in a silk

kimono, the chairman at my side.



   

                   

-Chiyo is my new protoge.

-As lovely as her big sister.



   

                   

And with eyes the colour of rain.



   

                   

The baron is a very special

man to me, my “Danina,”



   

                   

someday if you are fortunate,

you will have a patron too.



   

                   

Don't kneel, you aren't

a servant girl anymore.



   

                   

Step into the light.



   

                   

-I see water in you.

-Does that displease you?



   

                   

Water is powerful. It can wash away

earth, put out fire, and even destroy iron.



   

                   

But you have not drawn on

those strengths have you?



   

                   

-About your kimono...



   

                   

You may apologise if you wish.



   

                   

Why that is a perfect

bow, for a pig farmer...



   

                   

Don't drop your head, fingertips together,

elbows in, no weight on the hands.



   

                   

-Yes.



   

                   

As for the kimono, I’m no fool Chiyo.



   

                   

-Hatsumomo cannot tolerate competition

-She is jealous of you...



   

                   

Not me I'm afraid,

someone closer to home.



   

                   

Rise.



   

                   

Not like a horse.



   

                   

Slide your foot forward.



   

                   

That's it. Now walk. You

are a magnificent Geisha.



   

                   

Tell me Chiyo, does Mrs.

Nita ever speak of the future?



   

                   

Not to me.



   

                   

Well someday soon she will

have to name an heir.



   

                   

One of her own Geisha to succeed her.



   

                   

Strange isn't it that she

hasn't adopted Hatsumomo?



   

                   

That would be like releasing

a tiger from it's cage.



   

                   

You have a gift for expression.



   

                   

And if Mrs. Nita adopts

Pumpkin that is hardly a threat…



   

                   

… but a young girl

with eyes like rain...



   

                   

But Mrs. Nita would never choose me.



   

                   

-On the contrary, that is our goal.

-It is?



   

                   

Of course. If you do not inherit the

okea, then we will all be at the tiger's mercy.



   

                   

Water is always in such a

hurry, perhaps that is just as well.



   

                   

We have no time to lose.



   

                   

We must transform you.



   

                   

And what takes years,you

must learn in months.



   

                   

Say I’m entertaining the baron.



   

                   

Like so many clients he's trapped

in an arranged marriage.



   

                   

So in the tea-house when he's

seeking my company instead,



   

                   

I reward him like this with

a glimpse of my wrist.



   

                   

Seeing this demure little trace of

naked skin, well it gives him pleasure.



   

                   

Or when you're sitting down, for the

briefest moment, press your leg against his.



   

                   

Always by accident,of course.



   

                   

Mameha, when does a

Geisha choose her patron?



   

                   

I'm afraid it's the other way around, focus on

your studies Chiyo, music, the art of conversation,



   

                   

That's the surest way to attract a

patron on your feet, not off them!



   

                   

Remember Chiyo, Geisha are not

courtesans, and we're not wives.



   

                   

We sell our skills, not our bodies.



   

                   

We create another secret

world, a place only of beauty.



   

                   

The very word Geisha means

artist, and to be a Geisha …



   

                   

… is to be judged as

a moving work of art.



   

                   

Agony and beauty, for

us, live side by side.



   

                   

Your feet will suffer,

your fingers will bleed.



   

                   

Even sitting and

sleeping will be painful.



   

                   

You cannot call yourself a true Geisha until you

can stop a man in his tracks with a single look.



   

                   

-No one can do that.

-Choose someone for me.



   

                   

The grey hat...



   

                   

You are ready.



   

                   

Hurry up, you're not making money.

Standing there gawking at yourself.



   

                   

For luck.



   

                   

This binds us together

forever as sisters.



   

                   

Today you leave your childhood

and cast away your name.



   

                   

From this day forward you

will be known as Sayuri.



   

                   

When Mameha granted me my new name,



   

                   

I felt little Chiyo disappear

behind a white mask with red lips.



   

                   

I was a miko now, an apprentice Geisha.



   

                   

From that moment I told myself when I make tea,

when I pour sake, when I dance, when I tie my kimono…



   

                   

… it will be for the

chairman, until he finds me...



   

                   

… until I am his.



   

                   

-Ready?

-Big sister?



   

                   

Thank you.



   

                   

Friends, we have the pleasure to witness the

debut of another apprentice Geisha, cheers!



   

                   

I remember those eyes what was her name?



   

                   

Sayuri.



   

                   

Determined isn't she? If there had been a drop of tea in

that tea-pot I believe Sayuri would have gotten it out!



   

                   

I told you Mr. Baron, it

is her very first time.



   

                   

What a beautiful dance, yes Pumpkin?



   

                   

her fans are so hypnotic, that

you may not even notice her feet!



   

                   

What's her name? Her name is Sayuri.



   

                   

A name as sweet as she is. I'm afraid

that these days even a common chambermaid…



   

                   

… can call herself a Geisha. So it's nice to

see such a sincere young apprentice, isn't it?



   

                   

-Oh yes.

- Surely you would like to thank Hatsumomo for her gracious compliment.



   

                   

There is so much I would

like to say to Hatsumomo.



   

                   

Sometimes the smartest

remark is silence.



   

                   

What better advice to follow

you than your own? Sayuri!



   

                   

-I was a miko myself once.

- Of course! But it's been such a very long,



   

                   

long, long... long, long, time.



   

                   

I shall destroy you.



   

                   

She can destroy you. She

would spread rumours.



   

                   

Stalk you from

tea-house to tea-house.



   

                   

Then steal your clients, all in the hope that

Mrs. Nita adopts Pumpkin instead of you.



   

                   

-What can we do?

-We've got to outwit her,



   

                   

to find a place somewhere beyond her reach, where

you can practice your skills without any interference.



   

                   

-Your first sumo match.

-What?



   

                   

Today you will meet (Chairman) Iwamura.



   

                   

He is head of the Iwamura electric

company in Osaka. My client for years.



   

                   

We will entertain him and his partner

Nobu. You may find Nobu quite a challenge.



   

                   

He does not like Geisha.



   

                   

Be attentive, I will do the rest.



   

                   

Chairman Iwamura, President Nobu, this

is my new younger sister Sayuri.



   

                   

Injured in Manchuria, war hero.



   

                   

Sayuri, is this your first sumo match?



   

                   

Nobu-san will have to educate you, I

cannot tell one wrestler from the next.



   

                   

That is the Chairman's diplomatic

way of saying he hates sumo.



   

                   

Did you notice our contribution?



   

                   

We are harnessing the power of water to

bring electricity to some of the smaller villages.



   

                   

It was in the newspaper wasn't it?



   

                   

Ah, the Chairman's picture, yes, you

compensate for all my shortcomings don't you?



   

                   

May I ask, How does someone

harness the power of water?



   

                   

You should never ask an engineer

to explain a thing because he will!



   

                   

Let the girl watch sumo.



   

                   

Hatsumomo, that snake! Quick,

turn your attention to Nobu.



   

                   

But Mameha-san...



   

                   

Hatsumomo finds him repulsive,

she would never steal him away.



   

                   

Mislead her, go.



   

                   

Perhaps Nobu-san would be kind

enough to explain the rules of the match.



   

                   

Three things matter in

life... … sumo, business, and war,



   

                   

Understand one, you know them

all. But why should a Geisha care?



   

                   

You spend your time

plucking strings and dancing.



   

                   

I humbly beg to differ.



   

                   

What is sumo but a dance between giants?



   

                   

What is business but a

dance between companies?



   

                   

I'd like to know about

every kind of dance.



   

                   

They are throwing salt

to purify the ring.



   

                   

That man is Miyagi, the

greatest fighter in Japan.



   

                   

But he's so tiny! Only

compared to his opponent.



   

                   

Miyagi may use...



   

                   

Are you listening? Yes.



   

                   

Hataki-comi is a movement a smaller

opponent uses to throw a larger opponent off balance.



   

                   

Victory does not always

belong to the powerful!



   

                   

Look, there, in his eyes!



   

                   

I'm afraid our time has come

to a close. Going so soon?



   

                   

Not yet! I want her to see.



   

                   

Now that is Hataki-comi! I

see now why you like sumo.



   

                   

You can never judge a man's

power by his appearance alone.



   

                   

Mameha! You may bring her again.



   

                   

I scoured the newspaper for

the Chairman's photograph.



   

                   

Anything to preserve

our moment together.



   

                   

A moment, stolen, when I was

forced to turn my attention to Nobu.



   

                   

In that instant I

felt the world shift...



   

                   

But not my own determination



   

                   

I made a secret promise.



   

                   

Along with his picture, I would lock

away my heart, and save it for him.



   

                   

-Big sister.

-Come here.



   

                   

Tonight we will deliver a quick

blow to Hatsumomo - Hataki-comi.



   

                   

-How? -We will meet

Nobu-san at the Sunashima restaurant.



   

                   

-But first a visit to Dr. Crab.

-Dr. Crab?



   

                   

It's a little nickname

he's earned over the years.



   

                   

-Sister!

- Hold still!



   

                   

I have something in mind, a plan.



   

                   

Now cut your leg where I've marked it.



   

                   

-What?!

-Or I will do it for you.



   

                   

-Have you gone mad?

-Do you trust me or don't you?



   

                   

Well?



   

                   

Go ahead, do it!.



   

                   

Careless with the

sowing scissors were you?



   

                   

Right through your beautiful

kimono. Such a pity.



   

                   

It won't leave a scar will

it? Sayuri is a special girl…



   

                   

… at a very special time in her life.



   

                   

Yes, with those eyes! You

must be quite a commodity.



   

                   

Clean cut, won't leave

a mark, I promise.



   

                   

But I had best prescribe

a bit of antiseptic.



   

                   

Your honourable sister says

cut your leg? You cut your leg.



   

                   

She says follow me? You follow

her. My life had turned into a game…



   

                   

… and only she knew the rules.



   

                   

At the right moment slip

it to Nobu – discreetly.



   

                   

He will know what it means.



   

                   

-You have kept us waiting.

-Please forgive us Nobu-san.



   

                   

The Chairman thinks I should take more

pleasure in life, music and the theatre.



   

                   

What is your impression?



   

                   

It is useless to push

your cart sideways,



   

                   

one could not wish Nobu-san to

be anyone other than Nobu-san.



   

                   

I could not agree more. I

owe this man everything.



   

                   

He gives me too much credit as usual.



   

                   

Probably, cheers! Cheers!



   

                   

It is a trinket, I found

it a few days ago...



   

                   

Nobu-san, I had no idea you were so

sentimental. Call it my “new leaf.”



   

                   

My mother... my mother, she

used to wear something similar.



   

                   

You do not like it?



   

                   

Forgive me, I've never

received a present before.



   

                   

What a beautiful comb.



   

                   

Such a joyous moment Sayuri.



   

                   

You're finally getting what you deserve.



   

                   

How lovely.



   

                   

And now will you excuse us please, we

have another engagement, many in fact.



   

                   

Pumpkin?



   

                   

You are most kind.



   

                   

-Now give this one to Dr. Crab.

-Mameha please...



   

                   

-You're upset?

-I want to trust you I do…



   

                   

… but you have to tell

me what's going on.



   

                   

-I am ensuring your future.

-But tell me how, I beg you.



   

                   

-I am trying to orchestrate a bidding war.

-What for?



   

                   

-Your most precious attribute.

-And what is that?



   

                   

Your misuage (virginity).



   

                   

Did mother ever tell you

about the eel in the cave?



   

                   

Well, every once in a while, a man's

eel likes to visit a woman's cave.



   

                   

Yes I know. You do?



   

                   

I live with Hatsumomo.



   

                   

Well, your cave is untouched... men

like that. We call this misuage (virginity).



   

                   

And to become a full Geisha we must

sell this to the highest bidder.



   

                   

Did you sell yours?



   

                   

It was the largest sum ever paid

- Ten thousand yen.



   

                   

I freed myself from

debt, and so will you.



   

                   

When you slip the rice-cake to Dr. Crab it is a sign

that says your misuage (virginity),is ripe for sale.



   

                   

The Dr. has no desire to see

you tonight... or any night.



   

                   

-Pumpkin! Hatsumomo went to see Dr.

Crab, yes? -I have to go Chiyo-chan.



   

                   

-Didn't she?

-I do not know.



   

                   

Of course you know! You

shadow her every step.



   

                   

-You expect me to betray my big sister.

-Has she made you cruel as well?



   

                   

-No.

-My Pumpkin always told the truth.



   

                   

The truth…



   

                   

Tonight, we went to the tea-house to see Dr. Crab. I

sat outside but I could still hear through the screen...



   

                   

... and Hatsumomo then said to him “I live in the same Okea as

Sayuri, and did you know that she brings men back to her room?”



   

                   

“No” he said, “they come in, sailors, and fishermen too.” And

the Dr. looked queezy like he didn't want to hear any more,



   

                   

But she kept going. And Hatsumomo

said to him “what's the matter?”



   

                   

“have I told you more than you wanted to

know?” I'm so sorry, I wanted to say something…



   

                   

… but how could I Chiyo-chan? … how?



   

                   

Am I really like her?



   

                   

-Am I?

-Of course not.



   

                   

-Is Mameha-san cruel to you

too? -No, she's so kind to me...



   

                   

... but sometimes I worry she's taken

me further from the things I want.





 

                   

-That man Nobu. Do you really like him?

-No.



 

                   

That's what I thought.



 

                   

Do you like somebody else?



 

                   

Don't worry about me

Chiyo-chan. I'll be fine. Better than fine.



 

                   

Mother plans to adopt me, so my dream of

having some place to live out my life may come true.



 

                   

I have to go.



 

                   

-We could still win Sayuri.

-How?



 

                   

Hatsumomo has poisoned

Dr. Crab against me.



 

                   

Forget about him, there are

plenty of other fish in the sea.



  

                   

The Chairman has been kind...



  

                   

Sayuri! Nobu and the

Chairman are business partners,



  

                   

they would never bid against one

another. It is time we cast a wider net.



  

                   

Suppose there was a night in Myoko. Hundreds

of men all in one place, eager to bid for you.



  

                   

-What do you mean?

-Where you are the object of all their fantasies.



  

                   

The most famous Geisha in the Hanamachi.



  

                   

-But I'm not.

-You will be…



  

                   

-Who is responsible for this?

-Ask Mameha.



  

                   

-I'm asking you Mother.

-How come Sayuri gets to be the lead?



  

                   

It's your own fault. You

should practice more.



  

                   

What did Mameha do, speak

to the director in private?



  

                   

Not every Geisha uses

that kind of currency.



  

                   

I'm looking forward to your performance. You

know how I adore watching you dance... Chiyo.



  

                   

They've all come,



  

                   

the Baron, Nobu-san, our beloved

Hatsumomo, and that dapper General of hers..



  

                   

Anybody else? And even

your old friend, Dr. Crab.



  

                   

Big-sister, what if I dance

poorly, what if I disgrace myself,



  

                   

and no one takes interest?



  

                   

Sssh,you will be glorious.



  

                   

Now, it's time.



  

                   

-Sayuri, you remember the Doctor.

-I hope my performance pleased you Doctor.



  

                   

-Aah, you danced with such profound fury.

-I most humbly thank you.



  

                   

It seems you've once again

caught the Doctor's interest.



  

                   

And I am most grateful. If

you have heard any gossip...



  

                   

-Ah yes?

-Then I hope you will follow your own advice.



  

                   

-And what would that be, pray tell?

-Seek a second opinion.



  

                   

Ah Chairman. Sayuri gave such a

passionate performance, don't you think?



  

                   

Indeed.



  

                   

Mameha, did you invite the Chairman

to my estate this weekend?



  

                   

-It's my annual blossom viewing party.

-Baron, I told you I can't go.



  

                   

-I have an urgent appointment.

-Taking care of a little nuisance,



  

                   

or was that a naughty secret? Baron,

wouldn't Sayuri look stunning…



  

                   

-among the flowers on your estate?

-Yes, very pretty.



  

                   

-Be sure to send her along.

-With a chaparone of course,



  

                   

I'm certain Mr. Bekku will oblige.



  

                   

That's a fine idea Baron, but Sayuri

is required at the theatre.



  

                   

-Mameha, I expect her there.

-Nobu, coming Saturday?



  

                   

All that way to see a cherry

tree? I will leave that to the Chairman.



  

                   

[You were] wonderful tonight. Excuse me.



  

                   

-If you would rather not go.

-I'd like to go very much.



  

                   

Then be on your guard, every moment. There

is a reason Hatsumomo wants you there.



  

                   

Trust me, I know my Baron Sayuri.



  

                   

He has a weakness for beautiful women.



  

                   

And now, you are the most celebrated

Geisha in all Myoko.



  

                   

The most desired as well.



  

                   

Sayuri, today, even the cherry

blossoms are envious of her.



  

                   

There's something I've been wanting

to say to you for some time now.



  

                   

I'd like to...



  

                   

to thank you for your

attention to Nobu-san.



  

                   

Nobu can be a difficult man.



  

                   

So you see dear, at parties,

sake only in moderation.



  

                   

And he disdains Geisha.



  

                   

But he…



  

                   

… he’s fond of you.



  

                   

Because you admire

him, I respect him more.



  

                   

He would never tell you

himself. He's far too modest.



  

                   

We were fighting in Manchuria

together, and there was an explosion.



  

                   

He protected me from the worst of it.



  

                   

As you might imagine,

I owe him quite a debt.



  

                   

Nobu has taught me a great

deal, patience, for one thing.



  

                   

I, in turn, have tried to teach him.



  

                   

You have to savour life while you can.



  

                   

The legend of the cherry blossom.



  

                   

That is why Nobu likes you. We

must not expect happiness Sayuri,



  

                   

it is not something we deserve. When

life goes well, it's a sudden gift,



  

                   

it cannot last forever.



  

                   

Ah Sayuri, there you go.

I have a present for you.



  

                   

Mameha asked me to show

you my kimono collection.



  

                   

It's quite venerated, my

grandfather and father,



  

                   

collected kimono before me.



  

                   

I've given a number of valuable kimono to

Mameha. I like to give presents to beautiful girls.



  

                   

It's for you.



  

                   

Come, have a closer look.



  

                   

Isn't it lovely?



  

                   

-Try it on.

-The Baron is too kind.



  

                   

I will happily try it on, with

Mameha, when the Baron returns to Myoko.



  

                   

Who knows when that would be?



  

                   

Put it on now, don't be shy.



  

                   

Don't worry,



  

                   

I have experience in knotting

kimonos, and untying them as well.



  

                   

Please, Mr. Bekku is waiting.



  

                   

Mr. Bekku is waiting for no one.



  

                   

Please... stop!



  

                   

Please stop now!



  

                   

Sayuri, I only want to have a look.



  

                   

No harm in that. Any

man would do the same.



  

                   

I heard a message on the wind.



  

                   

So careless! You have

ruined all our plans!



  

                   

-I did nothing.

-Sayuri, do not insult me.



  

                   

I know the Baron better than that..



   

                   

-He gave me a kimono.

-You sold yourself for a kimono!



   

                   

I did not sell myself. Today is the day I

accept bids for your misuage (virginity).



   

                   

But what kind of price can I hope to

demand with a finger pointed at your back?



   

                   

-He looked at me that's all big-sister. -You

will be examined at the misuage ceremony.



   

                   

-If you are found to be worthless...

-I am not worthless!



   

                   

I am not worthless.



   

                   

How much longer is this

bidding going to take?



   

                   

Besides, who wants a plum when

someone has already had a bite?



   

                   

What is it? Twenty yen, thirty?



   

                   

-This can't be the right amount.

-I trust you agree, I have won the wager.



   

                   

Sayuri's made history, no misuage

has ever been sold for more.



   

                   

Not even mine. Fifteen thousand yen.



   

                   

Unbelievable. Thank you sister.



   

                   

Of course none of it will go

to Sayuri, or to you Mameha.



   

                   

It goes to this okea. All fifteen

thousand yen. To this estate.



   

                   

-I do not understand.

-That, Sayuri, you will inherit as my adopted daughter.



   

                   

-What?

-You wouldn't dare!



   

                   

I'm entitled to do as I choose.



   

                   

But you promised the okea to Pumpkin!



   

                   

Look at her, still a

virgin apprentice. Pumpkin!



   

                   

Can't you adopt us both? Quiet Sayuri.



   

                   

Now I'm no fool. Pumpkin would

only be Hatsumomo's puppet.



   

                   

How long would it take before

you kick us out onto the street?



   

                   

-I have given you my life.

-Yes, and your impudence, your vile temper.



   

                   

Who paid for that kimono on your back,



   

                   

The rest in your ... The tobacco

in that paper of yours? Who?



   

                   

Don't exaggerate! You have

never even had a patron.



   

                   

Don't say it, don't say it! You

chose that no good Koichi.



   

                   

Peeking through your window at

all hours of the night. Quiet!



   

                   

Not like a Geisha, like

a common prostitute.



   

                   

Besides, you are getting old. But Sayuri,

Sayuri's destined to become a legend.



   

                   

My dear Mother. We will see. Won't we?



   

                   

Sayuri, your room is too

small. Take Hatsumomo's.



   

                   

From now on, your name is Nita Sayuri..



   

                   

-May I congratulate you both.

-You may.



   

                   

Big sister.Everything we

wanted you made happen. Thank you.



   

                   

-May I ask who?

-Dr. Crab.



   

                   

-Was Nobu disappointed?

-Nobu did not bid. It was against his mighty principles.



   

                   

Dr. Crab was opposed my the Baron, my

Baron. Do you want to know the truth Sayuri?



   

                   

He was the highest bidder. Forgive

me, but I let it go to Dr. Crab..



   

                   

-I think you understand why.

-I swear to you, I am innocent.



   

                   

Of course you are. No man would ever bid

so much for a thing he had already taken.



   

                   

It was my own fault.

I did not protect you.



   

                   

Celebrate this moment Sayuri. Tonight, the

lights in the Hanamachi all burn for you..



   

                   

My daughter...



   

                   

You are a full geisha now.



   

                   

What are you doing in my room?



   

                   

I came to congratulate you.



   

                   

Please get out.



   

                   

Why little Chiyo, look what I've found.



   

                   

His initials, how elegant.



   

                   

You've been hiding your

love for a long time.



   

                   

-The sacrifice every Geisha must make.

-Don't!



   

                   

Is this where you keep

it? Next to your heart?



   

                   

Give it back!



   

                   

Give it back!



   

                   

I could be her. Now I

am Geisha to this house.



   

                   

I could be her. Were we so

different? She loved once. She hoped once.



   

                   

I might be looking into my own future. Until

the real future came falling from the air.



   

                   

-Korin, have you see Sayuri?

-No... I don't know.



   

                   

Chairman! They are sending us

away but they won't say where.



   

                   

Osaka, but you must not go.

The city is a prime target.



   

                   

Get your things, quickly.



   

                   

Nobu and I are trying to find safe

havens for  as many people as we can.



   

                   

Come.



   

                   

Here, work certificates, nurse's aid. A

friend of mine is the chief surgeon in Kamioka.



   

                   

What about Sayuri? Can't we go together?



   

                   

Don't worry, she will be taken care of.



   

                   

Here we go.



   

                   

-Sayuri.

-Big sister.



   

                   

Sayuri come. This is Alima, he

will take you into the hills.



   

                   

Nobu has got a friend there, a kimono

maker. Anyone stops you, show them this.



   

                   

- Do I have to go?

-It's remote, you will be safe.



   

                   

What about you? You said

Osaka was dangerous..



   

                   

Our factory is there, I have no choice.



   

                   

Go, I will express your

gratitude to Nobu-san.



   

                   

A year without news, except news of

death. Defeat. Shame. Rumours of cities…



   

                   

… evaporating into clouds of smoke.

Then another year, and then another.



   

                   

Until the old life is a dream-life.



   

                   

Was I ever a Geisha?



   

                   

Did I ever dance, holding a fan? Who would

hold a fan now... or paint their lips?



   

                   

And then another

year. Nothing. Rice… work.



   

                   

Rice… work. Nothing.



   

                   

Sayuri.



   

                   

Sayuri, a man from

Osaka has come to see you.



   

                   

Nobu-san.



   

                   

General Tottori was captured

and tried as a war criminal..



   

                   

-The Baron lost his fortune and committed suicide.

-What about the okea?



   

                   

-Mr. Bekku has gone, but the others...

-Auntie and mother?



   

                   

Indestructible as always.



   

                   

-And the chairman?

-As well as can be expected.



   

                   

This is all that

remains of our factories.



   

                   

I'm so sorry Nobu-san.



   

                   

Sayuri...



   

                   

We want to rebuild, but to do

that we will need your help.



   

                   

What can I do?



   

                   

Somewhere, under those rags, are you

still the greatest Geisha in Myoko?



   

                   

If a tree has no leaves or branches,

can you still call that a tree?



   

                   

With nothing but rubble at my feet,

can I  still call myself a businessman?



   

                   

I should have taken better care

of you. Please, you saved my life.



   

                   

I owe you so much in return.



   

                   

The chairman and I

need American financing.



   

                   

There is a man, a certain Colonel Derricks

who has the power to grant us a contract.



   

                   

I showed him your

picture. He asked to meet you.



   

                   

I am not a persuasive man Sayuri,

but if you, and a few Geisha,



   

                   

would once again put on

your kimono and join us,



   

                   

we can show the Americans how

hospitable our country can be.



   

                   

How I wish Nobu-san. But

that was a long time ago.



   

                   

I have no doubt Sayuri, that you could

still melt the heart of any man....



   

                   

... no matter how resistant.



   

                   

I am not accustomed to begging,



   

                   

but please know that...



   

                   

… if you consent, the Chairman

and I would be most grateful.



   

                   

The Chairman needed me. But I was a

far cry from the Geisha I had once been.



   

                   

The secrets of our hidden world were

postcards now for girls back home.



   

                   

Any street-walker with a

painted face and silk kimono…



   

                   

… could call herself a Geisha..



   

                   

I looked for the one person

who might help. Mameha.



   

                   

The war was written on her face. Everything about

her, not just her home, was less than before.



   

                   

Sayuri, when my poor Baron filled his

pockets with stones, I was desperate.



   

                   

What could I do? I sold my kimono.

I traded my jade cones for rations.



   

                   

It was painful at first,

but I have made my peace.



   

                   

Now, I make a small but

tidy living renting rooms.



   

                   

-I am not about to go chasing the past.

-It might do you good.



   

                   

How?



   

                   

To remind you that once with a single glance, you

could bring a man like the Baron, to his knees.



   

                   

Well, I did keep one kimono.



   

                   

The Baron gave it to me

when he became my patron.



   

                   

Thank you big-sister.



   

                   

So tell me. What do we know

about entertaining Americans?



   

                   

Chiyo-chan, is that you?



   

                   

I have no right to ask favours

of you Pumpkin, I know that .



   

                   

Guess what? I only

smoke Chesterfield's now.



   

                   

I've wanted to apologise to you

for so long,about the okea.



   

                   

These soldier boys, you know

who they've got me singing?



   

                   

-It should have gone to you, not me.

-Frank Sinatra...



   

                   

-If it is in your heart to forgive me...

-Sayuri don't.



   

                   

The honest truth? I'd rather chew

sand than go back to all that.



   

                   

Then you are not angry with me?



   

                   

Don't worry about me chica-dee.. I've

got more clients than I can handle.



   

                   

You see so at-home

with these Americans.



   

                   

They're bastards!



   

                   

So, who's this colonel?



   

                   

Sounds like top-brass.



   

                   

He has the power to approve American

funding for Nobu and the Chairman.



   

                   

So, is he willing to pay

us American dollars? Cash?



   

                   

Don't waste my time. You

think I'm a sucker?



   

                   

I want sixty cases of Lucky Strike or

I'm taking my business to Sgt. McFee.



   

                   

I had to become a Geisha once more.



   

                   

Mother had reopened the okea,

but my powder-box was empty.



   

                   

My charcoal had turned to dust.



   

                   

And yet, it was my one chance

to see the Chairman again.



   

                   

Would he notice my weathered

hands? The threadbare silk?



   

                   

See...? You are yourself again.



   

                   

The world had changed

completely. Had he?



   

                   

And would I finally find the

strength to tell him all that I felt?



   

                   

Just look at you Sayuri, it's

as if the war did not happen.



   

                   

I'm so glad to see that

the Chairman's safe.



   

                   

-Please accept my apologies asking this of you.

-No



   

                   

There's nothing I can't

do to return your kindness.



   

                   

I've wanted to tell you that... Sayuri!



   

                   

May I present Colonel

Derricks. Konichiwa.



   

                   

My god, you're more stunning in person.



   

                   

This is my associate Lt. Hutchins.



   

                   

Sayuri is one of the mysteries

of the orient I told you about.



   

                   

-A mystery that perhaps you can solve.

-Would you mind? Can we?



   

                   

Yes, of course. Colonel?



   

                   

Beautiful.



   

                   

Hey, who likes whisky?



   

                   

Chairman, don't tell me you've

started the party without me.



   

                   

May I present Pumpkin?



   

                   

Gentlemen.



   

                   

You haven't change!You

look like a little boy!



   

                   

Good for him,not too good for us!



   

                   

-May we join you gentlemen?

-Yes please,I could get used to this!



   

                   

Back home a bath is nothin' more than a

shower and a cold towel with a lotta soap. Right?



   

                   

-But here you make everything a ritual don't you?

-That is the art of turning habit into pleasure Colonel.



   

                   

Spoken like a true Geisha.

- If we are in business together, then perhaps we will visit you some day.



   

                   

-I would like to see the United States.

-I know a little game we can play.



   

                   

-It's called truth and lies.

-I know this game.



   

                   

Back home we call it marriage.



   

                   

No,I'm serious.Now listen closely,



   

                   

Sayuri knows the rules.



   

                   

And every married woman who didn't!



   

                   

Each person says two things.

One is true, the other is not.



   

                   

If you guess right,

the liar pays the price.



   

                   

So it pays to lose? There you go.



   

                   

Ok I go first.Let's see.



   

                   

One day in Sapporo, where I was born,

a  fisherman caught a Token-fish...



   

                   

The other story is the true

one, and I haven't even heard it yet.



   

                   

-Now you drink.

-If I drown, it's all your fault.



   

                   

Please, I am no match for these

Geisha, they are expert in the art of deceit.



   

                   

I'm an expert in one thing,

and one thing only, Sake.



   

                   

Sayuri, the truest story you know.



   

                   

Once, when I was a little girl,

on the banks of the Sunagawa,



   

                   

a handsome stranger was kind enough

to buy me a cup of sweet ice...



   

                   

I think we have to stop the game…



   

                   

… if Pumpkin drinks any

more Sake, she will pass out.



   

                   

Ooh,that is the true story...



   

                   

So, what is the protocol?



   

                   

- Excuse me?

-Suppose I wanted to see you in private...



   

                   

I beg your pardon Colonel, that

is not a Geisha's custom.



   

                   

If it's a question of price?



   

                   

If there were a price,

you could never afford it.



   

                   

I saw the two of you whispering. You have

arranged some kind of twist, haven't you?



   

                   

What did you promise him?



   

                   

Your company, nothing more. He

seemed to expect a great deal.



   

                   

If I wanted a common whore,

I could have hired one.



   

                   

-What are you trying to say?.

-Just the idea of you, with him,with any man,



   

                   

you would be dead to me.



   

                   

Can't you see that I

want you for myself?



   

                   

You have ruined me. Before we

met I was a disciplined man.



   

                   

I should have listened to him.



   

                   

I must beg your forgiveness Nobu-san.



   

                   

I was foolish to think

you would barter me away.



   

                   

Please, don't insult me again.



   

                   

If he ratifies our contract, then

I will be a man of means again.



   

                   

There is nothing I want more

Sayuri, than to become your patron.



   

                   

-I already owe you far too much.

-I will not be refused.



   

                   

-Please don't...

- We are tied to each other. I know you feel it too.



   

                   

I never meant to mislead you.



   

                   

Sayuri…



   

                   

I do not like things held out

before me, that I cannot have.



   

                   

When you first introduced me to Nobu, I

was such a fool to give him my attention.



   

                   

-You cannot refuse him, you must not.

-But Mameha...



   

                   

-What is he to think? He safeguarded your life!

-So he owns it?!



   

                   

Sayuri, I know what it is like to

try to scrape by without a patron.



   

                   

I would do something,anything else.



   

                   

Leting rooms,scrounging for every

meal? Is this the life that you want?



   

                   

-I want a life that is mine!

- Nobu has never treated you with another other than kindness.



   

                   

-I don't want mere kindness.

-What? What more can we expect?



   

                   

We're Geisha.



   

                   

You had feelings for

the Baron didn't you?



   

                   

-I never allowed myself that.

-Don't lie to me.



   

                   

-In time, you learn.

-I don't want to learn!



   

                   

Sayuri!



   

                   

We don't become Geisha to

pursue our own destinies.



   

                   

We become Geisha because

we have no choice.



   

                   

-Pumpkin!

-What is it, what's wrong?



   

                   

-Nothing. I have a favour to ask, that's all.

-Ask.



   

                   

At nine o'clock, bring Nobu to the

pool, on the far side of the garden.



   

                   

Not a minute before,

not a minute after. Yes?



   

                   

And please, do not tell Nobu

that I will be there waiting.



   

                   

-It's a surprise?

-Yes. It's a surprise.



   

                   

-Wait!

-Are we doing this or not?



   

                   

Yes?



   

                   

Chairman? Chairman!



   

                   

How could you? You don't

know what you have done.



   

                   

-But I do.

-I do not understand.



   

                   

-Why did you have to bring the Chairman?

-Because I know how you feel about him.



   

                   

A long time ago, you took something from

me. The only thing I ever truly wanted.



   

                   

Well... now you know how it feels.



   

                   

The heart dies, a slow death,

shedding each hope like leaves...



   

                   

... until one day there are

none. No hopes. Nothing remains.



   

                   

She paints her face to hide her

face. Her eyes like deep water.



   

                   

It is not for Geisha to

want. It is not for Geisha to feel.



   

                   

Geisha is an artist

of the floating world.



   

                   

She dances. She sings. She entertains you,whatever

you want. The rest is shadows. The rest is secret.



   

                   

Sayuri, quick quick, the tea-house just called.

You are to meet a very important client tonight.



   

                   

-Who?

-It must be Nobu.



   

                   

Yes.



   

                   

He's going to be one of

the richest men in Osaka.



   

                   

He'll want to honour his

promise, to become your patron at last.



   

                   

It's about time, finally.

A return on my investment.



   

                   

-Giko, maybe one day, you'll be as lucky.

-No Geisha can ever hope for more.



   

                   

Chairman! Where is Nobu-san?



   

                   

-He won't be coming.

-Is something wrong?



   

                   

He knows what happened. It is

not in his nature to forgive.



   

                   

Chairman, what happened on the island...



   

                   

Please, you do not have to

explain. But I have shamed myself so deeply…



   

                   

… past all forgiveness. No, I

am the one who must be forgiven.



   

                   

-I do not understand.

-Perhaps if you had only known the truth.



   

                   

The truth?



   

                   

Some years ago, I was on my way to the theatre,

I saw a little girl weeping by the Sunagawa,



   

                   

-I stopped to buy her a cup of sweet ice.

-You knew I was that little girl?



   

                   

Didn't you ever wonder why

Mameha took you under her wing?



   

                   

Mameha came to me because of you.



   

                   

I wish you could have told me long ago.



   

                   

What could I do? I owe Nobu my life. .



   

                   

And so, when I saw he had a chance

at happiness with you, I stood silent.



   

                   

But...



   

                   

But I cannot any longer. I

hope... it is not too late.



   

                   

Don't be afraid to look at me

- Chiyo.



   

                   

Can't you see? Every step I have

taken, since I was that child on the bridge,



   

                   

has been to bring myself closer to you.



   

                   

You cannot say to the sun “more

sun,” or to the rain “less rain.”



   

                   

To a man Geisha can only be half a wife.



   

                   

We are the wives of

nightfall. And yet to learn of kindness…



   

                   

… after so much unkindness. To understand that

a little girl with more courage than she knew,



   

                   

would find that her prayers were

answered. Can that not be called happiness?



   

                   

After all, these are not the memoirs

of an empress, nor of a queen…



   

                   

… these are memoirs of another kind.
